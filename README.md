# NBA Trade Tree (getting refactored, will come back to soon)

## What will it be?

This project will be displaying an NBA trade timeline after a trade transaction occurs. These trees will displaying what assets emerge after a transaction.

## What tech is involved?

Currently, Node.js with TypeScript is used for the backend webscraping. Front-end will likely be TypeScript and React.
